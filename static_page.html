                        Use a free account on Azure and GitHub and implement a basic deployment pipeline using GitHub actions to create an Azure resource group and provision a Web App, a SQL Database, one AutoScale settings, at least one Alert rules, and monitoring (App Insights). Web App backend must be able to use that SQL database. Deploy a simple Web App to this infrastructure from the pipeline (can be just a static html page)
